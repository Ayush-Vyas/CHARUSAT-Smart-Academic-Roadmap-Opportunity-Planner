# Project Name: 
Secure File Encryption & Decryption System (PDF & Images) 
(With Visual Animation, Attempt Lock & Master Key Recovery). 

# Project Description: 
In the digital era, sensitive documents such as PDFs and images are frequently 
shared and stored online, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data 
breaches, and cyber threats. Many users lack simple yet powerful tools to 
protect confidential files with strong encryption and controlled access 
mechanisms. 
The proposed Secure File Encryption & Decryption System is a software-based 
solution designed to provide strong security for PDF and image files. The 
system allows users to encrypt files using a secret key or password, making 
them unreadable to unauthorized users. Only users with valid credentials can 
decrypt and access the original content. 
To enhance usability and security, the system includes visual animations to 
demonstrate encryption and decryption processes, an attempt lock mechanism to 
prevent brute-force attacks, and a master key recovery feature for authorized 
recovery in case the original key is lost. This system ensures confidentiality, 
integrity, and controlled access to sensitive digital files.
