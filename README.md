# Project Title
CHARUSAT Smart Academic Roadmap & Opportunity Planner

# Description
Many students at CHARUSAT often feel confused about semester planning, skill development, internships, projects, and placement preparation. Important academic and career-related information is usually scattered across multiple portals, circulars, and departments, making it difficult for students to plan their academic journey in a structured manner. Due to this, students sometimes miss valuable opportunities or start preparing too late.
The proposed system, CHARUSAT Smart Academic Roadmap & Opportunity Planner, is a web-based application that can be integrated into the existing CHARUSAT website. The system generates a personalized academic and career roadmap for students based on their branch, current semester, and selected career goal such as placements, higher studies, or entrepreneurship.
The platform provides semester-wise guidance including recommended skills, project ideas, certification suggestions, internship timelines, and university-level opportunities. Faculty members or administrators can upload and manage opportunities like internships, hackathons, workshops, and placement drives, which are shown only to eligible students.
The expected outcome is better academic planning, increased participation in opportunities, improved placement readiness, and a centralized support system that benefits both students and the university.
